To get the best experience, make sure you have:

* Linux system
* Fastfetch
* Kitty terminal (required for image rendering)

> ⚠️ Image rendering is not supported in all terminals.
>
> Kitty and similar GPU-accelerated terminals are required.

# 🐧 NixOS Installation

NixOS users should install the required dependencies through `configuration.nix`.

Add the following:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  fastfetch
  kitty
];
```

Then rebuild your system:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

---

# 🖥️ Installing Kitty Terminal

## Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kitty
```

## Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S kitty
```

## Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install kitty
```

```bash
kitty
```

---

# Installing Nerd Font (Required)

Icons and box characters require a Nerd Font.

## Recommended Font

JetBrainsMono Nerd Font

## Install the font

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
cd ~/.local/share/fonts

wget https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/JetBrainsMono.zip

unzip JetBrainsMono.zip

fc-cache -fv
```

---

# Configure Kitty to use the font

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/kitty
nano ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
```

Add:

```text
font_family JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
```

Restart Kitty after saving.

---

# Verify font installation

```bash
echo "      "
```

If icons appear correctly, the font is set up properly.

---

# 🚀 Easy Installation (Recommended)

This project includes an interactive installer that handles the configuration process for you.

## 1️⃣ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/alhattami0/cs-hub-fastfetch.git

cd cs-hub-fastfetch
```

---

## 2️⃣ Run the installer

```bash
chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh
```

---

## 3️⃣ What the installer does

* Ensures required directories exist
* Verifies required dependencies
* Lets you select a theme
* Lets you select a layout style
* Displays a screenshot preview (when Kitty is available)

For NixOS users, dependencies should always be managed through `configuration.nix`.
